## Motivation

I've never been much into the whole new year resolution trend. I was always more the 'if you want to change something, don't wait' type of guy. But heck, why not make an exception, maybe it will work for me and I will be the exception and not quit after a week.

So the goal of this entire website is to keep track of my progress by writing small blogs of what I've learned monthly and also sharing some of the projects I've worked on, or I am working on.
